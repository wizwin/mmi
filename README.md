MMI - Mount My Image

MMI is a script to help you extract and analyze Android OS images.

Currently the following images are supported:
1. system
2. boot
3. recovery
4. factory
5. DT (Device Tree)
6. Non-HLOS

TODO
- Need to support more and latest formats
- Need to work on better command line parsing (It is very bad at the moment)
